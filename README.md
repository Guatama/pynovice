# pynovice [OLD]
I learn Python 3. Here I post the code which I write in the learning process.

- **dayslib** --> A small module for counting the number of days before a date, and vice versa
- **days2date_inline** --> `python days2date_inline.py {number of days}` -> return a date from today in CLI
- **dice.py** --> Roll the dice on the command line
- **tictactoe_game.py** --> Implementing a tic-tac-toe game for the command line
